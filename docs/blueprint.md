# **App Name**: BeachSnap

## Core Features:

- Filter Selection: Allow users to select from a range of beach-themed filters (e.g., sunset, sepia, black and white) to apply to their photos.
- Photo Capture Sequence: Implement a capture button that triggers a sequence of three photos, each taken 3 seconds apart.
- Photo Collage Generation: Automatically create a vertical collage of the three captured photos.
- Print Functionality: Add a 'Print' button that sends the collage to a printer for physical copies. Assume a generic AirPrint/CUPS driver is sufficient to start.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft coral (#F08080), evoking a gentle, warm beach vibe.
- Background color: Very light peach (#FAF0E6) creating a soft, inviting backdrop.
- Accent color: Turquoise (#40E0D0), a complementary color adding a touch of freshness and vibrancy, used for the print button.
- Font: 'Poppins' sans-serif font for all text, maintaining a modern, clear, and friendly look.
- Use simple, line-based icons for filter selection and other UI elements, ensuring clarity and ease of use.
- Employ a clean, vertical layout optimized for mobile devices, with the collage prominently displayed.
- Implement subtle animations for the countdown timer and photo capture sequence, providing engaging visual feedback.
